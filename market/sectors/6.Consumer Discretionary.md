# Consumer Discretionary

Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.               

Companies that supply these types of goods and services are usually either called consumer discretionaries or consumer cyclicals.
